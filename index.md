## Welcome to Karuta City Maid Documentation!
Welcome to the Karuta City Maid Bot Documentation! If for some reason you're lurking here but havent join us yet, [why not?](https://discord.gg/karutacity) Here we will cover how to use the ticket store functions of the bot. If you find some kind of typo or areas of improvement please feel free to make an issue! We will try and resolve it asap.

### Using the ticket store (as a seller):
<br>
<b>During the buying process</b><br><br>
When you kv your card (or if a mod/admin kvs for you) the bot will automatically react both `ticket` and `check`:<br>

Basically, if someone reacts `ticket`, you will be DM'ed about someone being interested in your card. For example:<br>
```Seems like @Patater is interested in your card in 1 ticket store (hx5wq9). If you think that is a mistake, please type g!report hx5wq9 [a short explaination] so the mods can deal with it! Thank you!```<br>

This will only happen once, because once the first person reacts, when someone else reacts the bot will not DM you. (unless you reset it when the person isn't interested.)
Now, you should DM the person and ask if they are interested. If they are interested, Great! If they aren't, don't fret! Read on. I never posted that card for sale? Don't worry, we got your back. Read on.<br><br>
<b>After the buying process</b><br><br>
Congrats! Your card is now sold. Please go back to the post and react `check`. The post will be automatically deleted. Hurray!<br><br>

### Using the ticket store (as a buyer):

When you see a card you would like to buy, just react to `ticket`! The owner of the card would be DMed with your intentions so they can contact you for the trade. Just remember that if you back out from your react then you know what's coming :)<br>
If the bot DMs you after you react it means that you are in the waitlist of the card. The bot will dm you when you are the new buyer!

### FAQs
<b>The person isn't interested anymore. What the heck?</b><br><br>
Don't worry. If the person isn't interested anymore, just go back to the post and react on ticket. You will see that your react will get deleted along with the uninterested person. The person wouldn't go unscathed though. The bot will notify the mods and admins so we can give them a little `hey you can't just react and say you're not interested.` If you have someone queueing for the card, you would be DMed with the code of the person.<br><br>
<b>I didn't even post the card. Why am I getting these DMs?</b><br><br>
Don't worry. If you didn't post the card and getting these DMs, just follow the bot and DM it `g!report [card code] [a brief reason]`.<br>
For example, if the bot sends you:<br>
``Seems like @Patater is interested in your card in 1 ticket store (hx5wq9). If you think that is a mistake, please type g!report hx5wq9 [a short explaination] so the mods can deal with it! Thank you!``<br>
DM the bot:
``g!report hx5wq9 I didn't post this card but I am recieving the DMs. Can you check the logs for me?``<br>

The bot will then notify the mods and admins and we will do a `you don't own this card why are you posting it?` :) <br><br>
<b>I can only see invalid-user as the buyer. What should I do?</b><br><br>
If you see invalid-user, please DM an admin, moderator or helper and they can get the id and the username of the buyer for you!<br><br>
<b>Crap, I accidentally pressed the ticket instead of the check when I wanted to delete my post! What should I do?</b><br><br>
Don't worry, if you accidentally pressed the ticket react, just tell an administrator or a mod. They won't warn you if you tell them. But if you do forget you will be warned in your second offence!<br><br>
